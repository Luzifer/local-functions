# Luzifer / local-functions

`local-functions` is intended as the opposite of Cloud-Functions: Run scripts on the local machine through HTTP calls.

**Be aware:** This will expose scripts in a certain folder on your machine. This might cause trouble for you! So you really should only expose the server on **localhost** and ensure nobody else is able to access the API.
